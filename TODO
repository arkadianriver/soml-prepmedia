☐ Maybe change drag and drop behavior to simple multi-file selection window with full paths
☐ maybe add link to images (maybe push/pop static paths if dynamic)
  - ~new exiftool read of same files displayed as JSON only in modal?~
  - ~..displayed as exifList all grayed out unchecked?~
  - send only response message as okay or error ~and if all okay, clear the exifList?~
☐ Possibly reconsider writing default replacements to config depending on workflow.
  - Seems CreateDate is UTC for vidz, local for picz?
☐ check filename for date to choose. If format provided (in global apply), use that;
   - otherwise, translate Phil Harvey's InverseDateTime() to JavaScript and use
